##  **Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise**

This page contains a web-friendly version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Emergency Directive 21-01, “_Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise_”.

*Section 3553(h) of title 44, U.S. Code, authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in response to a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or incident that represents a substantial threat to the information security of an agency, to “issue an emergency directive to the head of an agency to take any lawful action with respect to the operation of the information system, including such systems used or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency, that collects, processes, stores, transmits, disseminates, or otherwise maintains agency information, for the purpose of protecting the information system from, or mitigating, an information security threat.” [44 U.S.C. § 3553(h)(1)–(2)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3553%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3553)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true)*

*Section 2205(3) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, delegates this authority to the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. [6 U.S.C. § 655(3).](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:6%20section:655%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section655)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true)*

*Federal agencies are required to comply with these directives. [44 U.S.C. § 3554 (a)(1)(B)(v)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3554%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3554)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true)*

*These directives do not apply to statutorily-defined “national security systems” nor to systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community. [44 U.S.C. § 3553(d), (e)(2), (e)(3), (h)(1)(B).](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3553%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3553)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true)*

### Background
SolarWinds Orion products (affected versions are 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1) are currently being exploited by malicious actors. This tactic permits an attacker to gain access to network traffic management systems. Disconnecting affected devices, as described below in Required Action 2, is the only known mitigation measure currently available.

CISA has determined that this exploitation of SolarWinds products poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and requires emergency action. This determination is based on:

-   Current exploitation of affected products and their widespread use to monitor traffic on major federal network systems;

-   High potential for a compromise of agency information systems;

-   Grave impact of a successful compromise.

CISA understands that the vendor is working to provide updated software patches. However, agencies must wait until CISA provides further guidance before using any forthcoming patches to reinstall the SolarWinds Orion software in their enterprise.

Please refer to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for possible tactics the threat actors are using to [maintain persistence in the environment](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/).

### Required Actions

This emergency directive requires the following actions:

1.  *Agencies that have the [expertise](#what-does-the-directive-mean-by-expertise) to take the following actions immediately must do so before proceeding to Action 2.* ***Agencies without this capability shall proceed to Action 2.***

    a.  Forensically image system memory and/or host operating systems hosting all instances of SolarWinds Orion versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1]. Analyze for new user or service accounts, privileged or otherwise.

    b.  Analyze stored network traffic for [indications of compromise](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/13/active-exploitation-solarwinds-software), including new external DNS domains to which a small number of agency hosts (e.g., SolarWinds systems) have had connections.

{:start="2"}
2.  Affected agencies shall immediately **disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products, versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1, from their network**. Until such time as CISA directs affected entities to rebuild the Windows operating system and reinstall the SolarWinds software package, **agencies are prohibited from (re)joining the Windows host OS to the enterprise domain**. Affected entities should expect further communications from CISA and await guidance before rebuilding from trusted sources utilizing the latest version of the product available. Additionally:

    a.  **Block all traffic** to and from hosts, external to the enterprise, where *any version of* SolarWinds Orion software has been installed.

    b.  **Identify and remove** all threat actor-controlled accounts and identified persistence mechanisms.

{:start="3"}
3.  **By 12pm Eastern Standard Time on Monday December 14, 2020 agencies shall report as an incident** to CISA (at <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report>) the existence of any of the following:

    a.  \[SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\] with a file hash of \[b91ce2fa41029f6955bff20079468448\]

    b.  \[C:\\WINDOWS\\SysWOW64\\netsetupsvc.dll\]

    c.  Other indicators related to this issue to be shared by CISA

{:start="4"}
4.  **After (and only after) all threat actor-controlled accounts and identified persistence mechanisms have been removed**:

    a.  Treat all hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software as compromised by threat actors and assume that further persistence mechanisms have been deployed.

    b.  Rebuild hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software using trusted sources.

    c.  Reset all credentials used by or stored in SolarWinds software. Such credentials should be considered compromised.

    d.  Take actions to remediate kerberoasting, including, as necessary or appropriate, engaging with a 3rd party with experience eradicating APTs from enterprise networks. For Windows environments, refer to the following:

      * See Microsoft’s documentation on kerberoasting: <https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/detecting-ldap-based-kerberoasting-with-azure-atp/ba-p/462448>

      * Require use of long and complex passwords (greater than 25 characters) for service principal accounts and implement a good rotation policy for these passwords.

      * Replace the user account by Group Managed Service Account (gMSA). See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview> and Implement Group Managed Service Accounts: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview>.

      * Set account options for service accounts to support AES256_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 and not support DES, RC4, or AES128 bit encryption

      *  Define the Security Policy setting, for Network Security: Configure Encryption types allowed for Kerberos. Set the allowable encryption types to AES256_HMAC_SHA1 and Future encryption types. <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-configure-encryption-types-allowed-for-kerberos>

      * See Microsoft’s documentation on how to reset the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket password, twice: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password>

5. By 12pm Eastern Standard Time on Monday December 14, 2020, **submit a report to CISA** using the [provided template]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/report/ed21-01status.xlsx). Department-level Chief Information Officers (CIOs) or equivalents must submit completion reports attesting to CISA that the affected devices were either disconnected or powered down.

*These requirements apply to any agency network utilizing the SolarWinds Orion product. This includes any information system used or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency, that collects, processes, stores, transmits, disseminates, or otherwise maintains agency information.*

### CISA Actions

-   CISA will continue to work with our partners to monitor for active exploitation associated with this vulnerability. CISA will release additional indicators of compromise as they become available.

-   CISA will provide additional guidance to agencies via the CISA website, through an emergency directive issuance coordination call, and through individual engagements upon request (via [CyberDirectives@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:CyberDirectives@cisa.dhs.gov)).

### Duration

This emergency directive remains in effect until all agencies have applied the forthcoming patch or the directive is terminated through other appropriate action.

#### Additional Information
* General information, assistance, and reporting -- <CyberDirectives@cisa.dhs.gov>
* Reporting indications of potential compromise -- <Central@cisa.dhs.gov>

### Supplemental Guidance
_December 18, 2020_

This section provides additional guidance on the implementation of CISA Emergency Directive (ED) 21-01, to include an update on affected versions, guidance for agencies using third-party service providers, and additional clarity on required actions. On December 13, 2020, CISA issued ED 21-01 to mitigate the SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise. As noted in ED 21-01, CISA continues to work with our partners to monitor for active exploitation associated with this compromise and will continue providing updated guidance to agencies as new information becomes available. ED 21-01 also indicated that agencies must wait until CISA provides further guidance before using any forthcoming patches to reinstall the SolarWinds Orion software in their enterprise. This supplemental guidance is the first in that series of guidance. CISA will continue to provide further guidance as new information becomes available.

ED 21-01 directed agencies to immediately disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion, versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1, from their network. As of this guidance and based on developing information, CISA is dividing this range of versions into two groups: versions that have been identified as containing a malicious backdoor (“affected versions”) and versions that have been identified as not containing that malicious backdoor (“unaffected versions”). ED 21-01 and this guidance also contain instructions relating to versions of SolarWinds Orion outside of this version range (“other versions”).

#### Affected Versions

The following versions are considered affected versions:
-   Orion Platform 2019.4 HF5, version 2019.4.5200.9083
-   Orion Platform 2020.2 RC1, version 2020.2.100.12219
-   Orion Platform 2020.2 RC2, version 2020.2.5200.12394
-   Orion Platform 2020.2, 2020.2 HF1, version 2020.2.5300.12432

Agencies that were using affected versions at any time prior to the issuance of ED 21-01 **must:**

1.	[**Keep these products disconnected**](#what-does-the-supplemental-guidance-mean-by-disconnected) as required by ED 21-01 pending further CISA guidance and not rebuild or reimage the affected platforms and host operating systems (OS), including (re)joining the host OS to the enterprise domain, until such time as CISA directs otherwise.

2.	Label and isolate all backups of the affected versions from their systems to prevent accidental re-introduction of malicious code to the production environment.

3.	Conduct forensic analysis or search, as appropriate based on capability, for indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other evidence of threat actor activity.

    a. Agencies running affected versions that have no capability to conduct forensic analysis (system memory, host storage, network) shall, at minimum, search for IOCs or    other evidence of threat actor activity published in ED 21-01, [Activity Alert AA20-352A](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a), and future associated guidance.
   
    b.	Agencies that find matches to these IOCs or evidence of threat actor activity through forensics analysis must report this as an incident to CISA through <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report>. If a reporting agency already submitted incident information to CISA, please send updates to CISA as you discover new evidence. 
   
    c.	Agencies running affected versions that have no capability to conduct forensic analysis and no capability to search for IOCs shall assume breach, report the incident to CISA through <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report>, and contact <central@cisa.dhs.gov> to coordinate finding a qualified service provider capable of conducting forensics.

_All other provisions specified in ED 21-01 remain in effect._

#### Federal Information Systems Hosted in Third-Party Environments (such as Cloud)

CISA is working closely with FedRAMP to coordinate the response to ED 21-01 with FedRAMP Authorized cloud service providers (CSPs). FedRAMP Authorized CSPs have been informed to coordinate with their agency customers. 

1.	 If FedRAMP Authorized CSPs are affected, their agency customers must report incidents to CISA in accordance with ED 21-01. Agencies hosting information in any third-party environment (FedRAMP Authorized or otherwise) must identify and contact their third-party service providers directly for status pertaining to, and to ensure compliance with, ED 21-01. 

2.	Agencies are also instructed to supplement their reporting under ED 21-01 to incorporate relevant information from third-party service providers (to the extent that agencies have not already included this information), including to [report any incident through CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report). In your incident reporting, please identify what data was exposed to the third-party service provider. 

#### Conditions for Reconnecting Unaffected Versions

At this time, CISA is still assessing whether it is appropriate to relax ED 21-01's requirement that agencies not install patches for their SolarWinds Orion software. Some older versions of SolarWinds Orion have been identified as not affected by the malicious backdoor. However, operating such older versions carries significant risk, because (1) like other types of older software, older versions of SolarWinds Orion contain known vulnerabilities; (2) the adversary that inserted the SolarWinds Orion backdoor is likely to be intimately familiar with SolarWinds Orion code, including known or unknown vulnerabilities that may exist separate and apart from the backdoor; and (3) this adversary has demonstrated the capability and willingness to exploit SolarWinds Orion to compromise U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private organizations. 

Agencies are permitted to power back up and reintroduce into an agency production environment SolarWinds Orion instances that were disconnected pursuant to ED 21-01 _**only if each of the following conditions are met:**_

1.  The instance currently uses an unaffected version of the SolarWinds Orion, which are listed below.

    a.  Orion Platform 2019.4 2019.4.5200.8890

    b.  Orion Platform 2019.4 HF1 2019.4.5200.8950

    c.  Orion Platform 2019.4 HF2 2019.4.5200.8996

    d.  Orion Platform 2019.4 HF3 2019.4.5200.9001

    e.  Orion Platform 2019.4 HF4 2019.4.5200.9045
    
2.	The instance _did not previously use_ an [affected version](#affected-versions) (i.e., the instance was never rolled back from an affected version) and the instance is not restored from an affected version.
    
3.	The agency first (1) hunts for threat actors in their environment using all IOCs and indicators of threat actor activity published about this threat activity in ED 21-01, [Activity Alert AA20-352A](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a), and any additional related guidance related to this activity published by CISA or provided by the information security community prior to the instance being reintroduced to the environment, _**and**_ (2) finds no evidence of such threat actor activity.

4.	The agency conducts a risk assessment to assess the impact of reintroducing the Orion Platform into agency production environments and accepts residual risk associated with running this unpatched software containing known vulnerabilities until such time as CISA permits agencies to patch these products.

5.	Block all incoming and outgoing (any:any) Internet traffic to and from hosts running SolarWinds Orion products (as required by ED 21-01).

6.	Follow the SolarWinds hardening guidelines provided by the vendor, which can be found at: <https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/core-secure-configuration.htm>
    
    EXCEPT: 
    
    a.	Agencies shall _**not**_ configure the SolarWinds software to implement SAML-based authentication that relies on Microsoft’s Active Directory Federated Services. This configuration is currently being exploited by the threat actor associated with this activity. 
    
    b.	Agencies shall _**not**_ follow the hardening guideline’s requirement to ensure their SolarWinds instance is patched to the latest version, pending further direction from CISA to do so.

7.	Ensure that the SolarWinds logs are being sent to the agency SOC for action.

#### Other Versions

Agencies continuing to run instances of SolarWinds Orion with other versions _**must**_ comply with steps 5-7 listed for unaffected versions.

Agencies may apply updates to host operating system running SolarWinds Orion products in accordance with their respective vulnerability and patch management policies and programs.

_All other provisions specified in ED 21-01 remain in effect._

### Frequently Asked Questions
Answers to common questions appear below.

* [What does the directive mean by "expertise"?](#what-does-the-directive-mean-by-expertise)
* [What does the supplemental guidance mean by "disconnected"?](#what-does-the-supplemental-guidance-mean-by-disconnected)

#### What does the directive mean by "expertise"?

By "expertise", we mean that you have staff or supporting personnel that are properly trained in taking a forensic image of system memory and have tooling readily-available to immediately do so.

#### What does the supplemental guidance mean by "disconnected"?

By "disconnected" we mean _disconnected from the network and powered **on**_ if the agency has the capability- or is seeking a capable service provider- to collect forensics images (system memory, host storage, network) off of the host or virtual machine, or _disconnected from the network and powered **off**_ if there is no such capability.
