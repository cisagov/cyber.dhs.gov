This page contains a web-friendly version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Binding Operational Directive 20-01 (draft) VDP template. See also the [.docx template]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/report/bod-20-01-vdp-template.docx).

<span style="color:red">
*This template is intended to assist your agency in the creation of a
vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) that aligns with [Binding
Operational Directive (BOD) 20-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01/).*</span>

-   <span style="color:red">
*Instructions for how to use the template are provided throughout
    the document in red and italic text and should be removed from your
    published policy.*</span>

-   <span style="color:red">
*You are encouraged to modify the template to suit your needs, but
    your policy must address all actions required by the Directive. It
    is **strongly recommended** that you use the template's language for
    the Authorization section.*</span>

-   <span style="color:red">
*CISA recommends that you review the [implementation
    guidance](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01/#compliance-guide)
    maintained in support of this directive, particularly the section
    [Consider prior
    art](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01/#consider-prior-art).*</span>

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
<span style="color:red">*AGENCY NAME*

<span style="color:red">_Month Day, Year_

### Introduction

<span style="color:red">*An introductory section that provides background information about your
organization and your VDP. It should take a committed, concerned, and
receptive tone.*

*AGENCY NAME* is committed to ensuring the security of the American
public by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. This
policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for
conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our
preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.

This policy describes **what systems and types of research** are covered
under this policy, **how to send us** vulnerability reports, and **how
long** we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing
vulnerabilities.

We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting
vulnerabilities they've discovered -- as set out in this policy -- so we
can fix them and keep our users safe. We have developed this policy to
reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security
researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.

### Guidelines

We request that you:

-   Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential
    security issue.

-   Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before
    you disclose it publicly.

-   Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user
    experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or
    manipulation of data.

-   Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a
    vulnerability's presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or
    exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence,
    or use the exploit to "pivot" to other systems.

-   Once you've established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any
    sensitive data (including personally identifiable information,
    financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets
    of any party), **you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and
    not disclose this data to anyone else**.

-   Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

### Authorization

<span style="color:red">*This section reflects your commitment to not take legal action against
anyone in the general public for security research activities that
represent a good faith effort to follow the policy.*</span>

<span style="color:red">*CISA **strongly encourages** keeping this language as-is. The language
is designed to be as welcoming to researchers as possible, and to avoid
"legalese" or other unnecessarily intimidating language.*</span>

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your
security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we
will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and
*AGENCY NAME* will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your
research.

### Scope

<span style="color:red">*This section defines which internet-accessible systems or services are
in scope of your policy. Your first published VDP must contain at least
one production system or service, and it must also describe the types of
tests that are allowed (or specifically not authorized).*</span>

<span style="color:red">*Alternately, instead of an **allowlist** that enumerates which systems
or services are in scope, you may choose to use a **blocklist** to
describe which are out of scope.*</span>

<span style="color:red">*Note:*</span>

-   <span style="color:red">*After your policy's publication, all newly launched
    Internet-accessible systems or services must be included* implicitly
    *in the scope (e.g., by indicating a wildcard \[\*\] on a domain's
    scope) or* explicitly *by updating the policy to account for these
    systems.*</span>

-   <span style="color:red">*At 2 years after the issuance of this directive, all
    internet-accessible systems or services must be in scope of your
    policy.*</span>

This policy applies to the following systems and services:

-   <span style="color:red">`*.agency-brand.gov`

-   <span style="color:red">`agency-form.gov`

-   <span style="color:red">`agency-service.gov`, and the following hostnames:

    -   <span style="color:red">`alpaca.agency-service.gov`

    -   <span style="color:red">`buffalo.agency-service.gov`

    -   <span style="color:red">`cassowary.agency-service.gov`

    -   <span style="color:red">`dormouse.agency-service.gov`

    -   <span style="color:red">Any other subdomain of `agency-service.gov` and all customer
        applications are excluded from this policy
        (`*.app.agency-service.gov` is specifically excluded, except
        for `*.service-proxy.app.agency-service.gov`.)

-   <span style="color:red">Source code at [https://github.com/agency-example/repo](https://github.com/agency-example/repo)</span>

**Any service not expressly listed above, such as any connected
services, are excluded from scope** and are not authorized for testing.
Additionally, vulnerabilities found in non-federal systems from our
vendors fall outside of this policy's scope and should be reported
directly to the vendor according to their disclosure policy (if any). If
you aren't sure whether a system or endpoint is in scope or not, contact
us at <span style="color:red">security@agency.gov</span> before starting your research or at the
security contact for the system's domain name listed in the [.gov
WHOIS](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/registration/whois.xhtml).

Though we develop and maintain other internet-accessible systems or
services, we ask that *active research and testing* only be conducted on
the systems and services covered by the scope of this document. If there
is a particular system not in scope that you think merits testing,
please contact us to discuss it first. We will increase the scope of
this policy over time.

### <span style="color:red">Types of testing

**The following test types are not authorized:**

-   Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests

-   Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating),
    social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing), or any other
    non-technical vulnerability testing

### Reporting a vulnerability

<span style="color:red">*This section describes communication mechanisms and processes for
submitting vulnerabilities. It must include instructions on where
reports should be sent (e.g., a web form, email address), a request for
the information your agency needs to find and analyze the vulnerability
(e.g., a description of the vulnerability, its location and potential
impact; technical information needed to reproduce; any proof of concept
code; etc.). Reporters must be allowed to submit a report anonymously:
you must not require the submission of personally identifiable
information, although you may request the reporter voluntarily provide
contact information.*</span>

<span style="color:red">*This is also a good place to pledge your agency to be as transparent as
possible about what steps you are taking during the remediation process,
as well as set expectations for when the reporter can anticipate
acknowledgement of their report.*</span>

*Information submitted under this policy will be used for defensive
purposes only -- to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities.*

**We accept vulnerability reports at <span style="color:red">this form</span> or via
<span style="color:red">security@agency.gov</span>**. Reports may be submitted anonymously.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.

We do not support PGP-encrypted emails at this time. For particularly
sensitive information, submit through our <span style="color:red">HTTPS web form</span>.

<span style="color:red">*Make sure that any web form you use has a strong HTTPS configuration.
Reporters who are concerned about the sensitivity of their report may
take steps to verify the HTTPS configuration first, and could be
discouraged or alarmed if weak or compromised protocols or ciphers are
in use.*</span>

#### What we would like to see from you

In order to help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend that
your reports:

-   Describe the vulnerability, where it was discovered, and the
    potential impact of exploitation.

-   Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the
    vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).

-   Be in English, if possible.

#### What you can expect from us

When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.

-   Within 3 business days, we will acknowledge that your report has
    been received.

-   To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the
    vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what
    steps we are taking during the remediation process, including on
    issues or challenges that may delay resolution.

-   We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.
